## MSML (Making Sense of Machine Learning)  
In this project, I aim to demystify the inner workings of machine learning models by visualizing various components of PyTorch and breaking down key concepts. Additionally, I will be building models from scratch using C++, offering a deeper understanding of how these models function at a lower level.

### Project Goals:

- **Component Visualization**  
  Visualizing key elements of PyTorch models to provide insights into how different layers and operations work together to form complex networks.
  
- **Model Building in C++**  
  Developing machine learning models from the ground up using C++, giving a hands-on approach to understanding model structure and functionality outside of standard libraries like PyTorch.

- **Bridging Theory and Practice**  
  Helping bridge the gap between theory and implementation by offering both high-level visualizations and low-level code implementations, allowing for a holistic understanding of ML models.
