# Whhat is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that it capable of reproducing 
a target set of continuous target output such that for every sample in X, there is associated
y often determined by a line of best fit.

The errors or residuals at each observation are measured to be the distance between the predicted
value and the actual value for that observation. We want to reduce this error such that we can 
capture the line of best fit.
